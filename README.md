# Obanshire Cub Scouts

This project was my final assignment from my HND in Web and Mobile Development at Glasgow Clyde College.

I completed this project over 5 months, from October to April 2023.

## Project Brief

The goal of this project was to create a PHP website for a fictional cub scouts company, following web development and design standards. The website must include the ability to create and sign in to both child and parent accounts, for parent accounts to upload images to a gallery within the website, and for the website to display current activities and posts surrounding the events within the organization. Child accounts may also register for events using the website and keep track of events they have registered for.

My project was completed by the deadline and received an A for its age-appropriate engaging design and attention to detail within its functionality.

## How to run

This project does not currently have a live host, so downloading it as a .zip file and running it in MAMP as a local server is recommended. To do this:

1. Download MAMP.
2. Open the MAMP application folder.
3. Navigate to the _htdocs_ folder.
4. Unzip the downloaded .zip file from this repo.
5. Drag the unzipped file into the _htdocs_ folder.
6. Open the MAMP application.
7. Click the _Start_ button on the top right corner of the application window.

You should now be able to access the live server on _http://localhost:<your_MAMP_port_here>/obanshire-cub-scouts/_ .
